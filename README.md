# 🏁 F1App — Live Formula 1 Tracker

F1App is a modern Android application built with Jetpack Compose for real-time Formula 1 race tracking.  
It displays a live table of driver positions during a simulated race, with support for adjusting simulation speed.  
Users can browse races from the last four seasons, search by name, and view basic information such as race name, country, and date.  
Race data is fetched from the OpenF1 API using Retrofit, following the MVVM architectural pattern with ViewModel and StateFlow.
